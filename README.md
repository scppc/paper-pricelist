# Paper-Pricelist
_Paper-Pricelist_ is a XML-based file format for exchanging paper article prices and technical properties. The standard consists of
a schema file (.XSD), a documentation in Excel (.XLSX) and a sample file (.XML).

### What can it be used for?
Print paper suppliers that distribute their articles in this format will allow for printers to automatically
import these price list into their business application.
